  abstract  = {The progress in the generation of synthetic images has made it crucial to assess their quality. While several metrics have been proposed to assess the rendering of images, it is crucial for Text-to-Image (T2I) models, which generate images based on a prompt, to consider additional aspects such as to which extent the generated image matches the important content of the prompt. Moreover, although the generated images usually result from a random starting point, the influence of this one is generally not considered. In this article, we propose a new metric based on prompt templates to study the alignment between the content specified in the prompt and the corresponding generated images. It allows us to better characterize the alignment in terms of the type of the specified objects, their number, and their color. We conducted a study on several recent T2I models about various aspects. An additional interesting result we obtained with our approach is that image quality can vary drastically depending on the latent noise used as a seed for the images. We also quantify the influence of the number of concepts in the prompt, their order as well as their (color) attributes. Finally, our method allows us to identify some latent seeds that produce better images than others, opening novel directions of research on this understudied topic.},

  abstract  = {With the availability of powerful text-to-image diffusion models, recent works have explored the use of synthetic data to improve image classification performances. These works show that it can effectively augment or even replace real data. In this work, we investigate how synthetic data can benefit few-shot class-agnostic counting. This requires to generate images that correspond to a given input number of objects. However, text-to-image models struggle to grasp the notion of count. We propose to rely on a double conditioning of Stable Diffusion with both a prompt and a density map in order to augment a training dataset for few-shot counting. Due to the small dataset size, the fine-tuned model tends to generate images close to the training images. We propose to enhance the diversity of synthesized images by exchanging captions between images thus creating unseen configurations of object types and spatial layout. Our experiments show that our diversified generation strategy significantly improves the counting accuracy of two recent and performing few-shot counting models on FSC147 and CARPK.},

To address this issue, one can rely on a semantic description of each class. A typical ZSL model learns a mapping between the visual samples of seen classes and the corresponding semantic descriptions, in order to do the same on unseen classes at test time. State of the art approaches rely on generative models that synthesize visual features from the prototype of a class, such that a classifier can then be learned in a supervised manner. However, these approaches are usually biased towards seen classes whose visual instances are the only one that can be matched to a given class prototype. We propose a regularization method that can be applied to any conditional generative-based ZSL method, by leveraging only the semantic class prototypes. It learns to synthesize discriminative features for possible semantic description that are not available at training time, that is the unseen ones. The approach is evaluated for ZSL and GZSL on four datasets commonly used in the literature, either in inductive and transductive settings, with results on-par or above state of the art approaches.",

  abstract  = {Recent years have shown an unprecedented growth of interest in Vision-Language related tasks, with the need to address the inherent challenges of integrating linguistic and visual information to solve real-world applications. Such a typical task is Visual Question Answering (VQA), which aims at answering questions about visual content. The limitations of the VQA task in terms of question redundancy and poor linguistic variability encouraged researchers to propose Knowledge-aware Visual Question Answering tasks as a natural extension of VQA. In this paper, we tackle the KVQAE (Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering about named Entities) task, which proposes to answer questions about named entities defined in a knowledge base and grounded in a visual content. In particular, beside the textual and visual information, we propose to leverage the structural information extracted from syntactic dependency trees and external knowledge graphs to help answer questions about a large spectrum of entities of various types. Thus, by combining contextual and graph-based representations using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), we are able to learn meaningful embeddings for information retrieval tasks. Experiments on the KVQAE public dataset show how our approach improves the state-of-the art baselines while demonstrating the interest of injecting external knowledge to enhance multimodal information retrieval. },

The discovered controls allow to vary semantic attributes in the generated images but usually lead to entangled edits that affect multiple attributes at the same time. Supervised approaches typically sample and annotate a collection of latent codes, then train classifiers in the latent space to identify the controls. Since the data generated by GANs reflects the biases of the original dataset, so do the resulting semantic controls. We propose to address disentanglement by subsampling the generated data to remove over-represented co-occuring attributes thus balancing the semantics of the dataset before training the classifiers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by extracting disentangled linear directions for face manipulation on two popular GAN architectures, PGGAN and StyleGAN, and two datasets, CelebAHQ and FFHQ. We show that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art classifier-based methods while avoiding the need for disentanglement-enforcing post-processing.",

To counterbalance this lack of visual data, each class to recognize is associated with a semantic prototype that reflects the essential features of the object. The general approach is to learn a mapping from visual data to semantic prototypes, then use it at inference to classify visual samples from the class prototypes only. Different settings of this general configuration can be considered depending on the use case of interest, in particular whether one only wants to classify objects that have not been employed to learn the mapping or whether one can use unlabelled visual examples to learn the mapping. This chapter presents a review of the approaches based on deep neural networks to tackle the ZSL problem. We highlight findings that had a large impact on the evolution of this domain and list its current challenges.},

GANs can produce realistic images, but they suffer from mode collapse and do not provide simple ways to get the latent representation of an image. On the other hand, VAEs do not have these problems, but they often generate images less realistic than GANs. In this article, we explain that this lack of realism is partially due to a common underestimation of the natural image manifold dimensionality. To solve this issue we introduce a new framework that combines VAE and GAN in a novel and complementary way to produce an auto-encoding model that keeps VAEs properties while generating images of GAN-quality. We evaluate our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively on five image datasets.},

It requires only one monocular sequence per dynamic object for training and consists in localizing dynamic objects using SLAM outliers, creating their masks, and using these masks to train a semantic segmentation network. We integrate the trained network in ORB-SLAM 2 and LDSO. At runtime we remove features on dynamic objects, making the SLAM unaffected by them. We also propose a new stereo dataset and new metrics to evaluate SLAM robustness. Our dataset includes consensus inversions, i.e., situations where the SLAM uses more features on dynamic objects that on the static background. Consensus inversions are challenging for SLAM as they may cause major SLAM failures. Our approach performs better than the State-of-the-Art on the TUM RGB-D dataset in monocular mode and on our dataset in both monocular and stereo modes. },

These class representations usually consist of either attributes, which do not scale well to large datasets, or word embeddings, which lead to poorer performance. A good trade-off could be to employ short sentences in natural language as class descriptions. We explore different solutions to use such short descriptions in a ZSL setting and show that while simple methods cannot achieve very good results with sentences alone, a combination of usual word embeddings and sentences can significantly outperform current state-of-the-art. },

Their usefulness is nevertheless often limited by the lack of control over the generative process or the poor understanding of the learned representation. To overcome these major issues, very recent work has shown the interest of studying the semantics of the latent space of generative models. In this paper, we propose to advance on the interpretability of the latent space of generative models by introducing a new method to find meaningful directions in the latent space of any generative model along which we can move to control precisely specific properties of the generated image like the position or scale of the object in the image. Our method does not require human annotations and is particularly well suited for the search of directions encoding simple transformations of the generated image, such as translation, zoom or color variations.
