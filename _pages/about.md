My research is in the area of **computer vision** with a particular interest on **relating visual and textual content** and **visual generative models**. I work at [CEA-List](https://list.cea.fr/en/), that is associated with [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en).

## Main public projects
* the [STUDIES](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-23-CE38-0014) project (2023-2027) aims at automatically conducting die studies at a large scale to better understand Ancient Numismatics.
* the [SHARP](https://project.inria.fr/sharp/) project (PEPR IA 2023 - 2027) aims to design, analyze and deploy intrinsically frugal models (neural or not) able to achieve the versatility and performance of the best models while requiring only a vanishing fraction of the resources currently needed.
* the [Vanguard](https://vanguard-horizon.eu/) project (EU Horizon 2023-2026) aims to strengthen the fight against trafficking in human beings through the provision of improved intelligence picture, delivery of advanced and trustworthy suite of tools, and realisation of innovative training activities.
* the [Deepgreen](https://deepgreen.ai/) project (France2030 ANR 2024-2027) that aims to develop an embedded artificial intelligence model that combines sovereignty, trust and frugality, by developping the Eclipse [AIDGE](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/aidge/aidge) open source software platform.

## Teaching
I give courses and tutorials of *deep learning* at [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) (since 2017). 


Before, I have given courses of *computer vision* at Centrale Paris (2016), tutorials of *NLP* at [INSTN](https://instn.cea.fr/en/) (2007-2009), courses of *video compression* at [Dublin City University](https://www.dcu.ie/) during my post-doc (2005-2006) and various tutorials at [Université Joseph Fourier](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) and [INP Grenoble](https://www.grenoble-inp.fr/en) during my thesis (2001-2003).

## Contact 
I am physicaly located at [Nano Innov](https://list.cea.fr/app/uploads/2023/10/Coming_to_nano-innov_2023.pdf). To get here, I'll need to give your name to reception first (the appointment must be planned in advance). On the day of your visit, please bring your passport or identity card. 

Mailing address: CEA Saclay - Nano-INNOV, DRT/LIST/DIASI/SIALV/LASTI, Bat 861 - PC 184 - F91191 Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex, France.

## Short bio
Hervé Le Borgne is a researcher at the CEA-List since 2006, carrying out research on computer vision and focusing on the links between visual and textual content. Previously, he received his Ph.D. from the INP Grenoble in 2004 and worked as a post-doc at Dublin City university from 2004 to 2006. He published more than 60 articles in international conferences and journals dealing with computer vision, multimedia retrieval, text-to-image models and more generally multimedia mining in order to extract semantic. He has served as a reviewer for several international conferences and journals, including CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, ACM Multimedia, IEEE T. PAMI and IEEE T. Multimedia. He has been a project manager since 2006, both for public funded projects and industrial contracts. He supervised 20 master students and co-advised seven Ph.D in collaboration with [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en) and [CNAM](https://www.cnam.eu/site-en/).
