My research is in the area of **computer vision** with a particular interest on **relating visual and textual content**.

## Main public projects
* the [Meerqat project](https://www.meerqat.fr/) (ANR 2019) proposes to tackle the problem of analyzing ambiguous visual and textual content by learning and combining their representations and by taking into account the existing knowledge about entities
* the [AI4MEDIA project](https://www.ai4media.eu/) (EU H2020) aspires to become a Centre of Excellence engaging a wide network of researchers across Europe and beyond, focusing on delivering the next generation of core AI advances and training to serve the Media sector, while ensuring that the European values of ethical and trustworthy AI are embedded in future AI deployments.

## Teaching
I give courses and TDs of *deep learning* at [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) (since 2017). 


Before, I have given courses of *computer vision* at Centrale Paris (2016), TDs of *NLP* at [INSTN](https://instn.cea.fr/en/) (2007-2009), courses of *video compression* at [Dublin City University](https://www.dcu.ie/) during my post-doc (2005-2006) and various TDs at [Université Joseph Fourier](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) and [INP Grenoble](https://www.grenoble-inp.fr/en) during my thesis (2001-2003).

## Contact 
I am physicaly located at [Nano Innov](https://list.cea.fr/app/uploads/2022/04/Coming_to_Nano_INNOV.pdf). To get here, I'll need to give your name to reception first (the appointment must be planned in advance). On the day of your visit, please bring your passport or identity card. 

My mailing adress is: CEA Saclay - Nano-INNOV, DRT/LIST/DIASI/SIALV/LASTI, Bat 861 - PC 184 - F91191 Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex, France.

## Short bio (for project proposals, yes)
Hervé Le Borgne is a researcher at the CEA LIST since 2006, carrying out research on computer vision and focusing on the links between visual and textual content. Previously, he received his Ph.D. from the INP Grenoble in 2004 and worked as a post-doc at Dublin City university from 2004 to 2006. He published more than 60 articles in international conferences and journals dealing with computer vision, multimedia retrieval, machine learning and more generally multimedia mining in order to extract semantic. He has served as a reviewer for several international conferences and journals, including CVPR, ACM Multimedia, IEEE T. PAMI, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, Multimedia Tools and Applications and IEEE T. Multimedia. He has been a project manager since 2006, both for public funded projects and industrial contracts. He supervised 20 master students and co-advised five Ph.D. in collaboration with Ecole Centrale Paris and CNAM. Currently, he co-advises three PhD students, some in collaboration with CNAM and CentraleSupelec.
